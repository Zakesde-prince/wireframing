# wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified blueprint of a website or app. It shows where each element—like menus, buttons, and content blocks—will go, without worrying about colors or images. Wireframes help designers and developers agree on structure before building the real thing.
## Key Elements of Wireframing

1. **Layout Structure**  
   Shows the overall page grid: where header, sidebar, content, and footer live.

2. **Navigation**  
   Defines menus, links, and buttons that let users move around your site.

3. **Content Placement**  
   Indicates where text, images, or videos will appear on each page.

4. **Functionality**  
   Marks interactive parts (like search boxes or forms) so you know what needs to work.
## Types of Wireframes

- **Low‑Fidelity Wireframes:**  
  Very simple—mostly boxes and placeholder text. Used early to sketch ideas quickly.

- **High‑Fidelity Wireframes:**  
  More detailed, with real-looking text, detailed layout, maybe basic interactivity. Used later to refine spacing and flow.
### Example Wireframe Type

The provided wireframe is **low‑fidelity** because it uses simple boxes and placeholder text to map out the page structure without detailed visuals.
## Wireframing Tools

Popular tools for creating wireframes include:
- **Balsamiq** – very quick sketch-style wireframes
- **Adobe XD** – integrates design and prototyping
- **Sketch** – macOS tool with strong plugin ecosystem
- **Figma** – browser‑based, real‑time collaboration, version history

**Why Figma?**  
- Works in your browser—no installs  
- Multiple people can edit at once  
- Built‑in components and plugins speed up your workflow  
- Easy to switch between low‑ and high‑fidelity wireframes
## Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development

- **Clarifies Requirements Early:** Stakeholders can see and approve the structure before any code is written.
- **Saves Time and Money:** Finding layout or flow issues on paper is much cheaper than fixing code later.
- **Improves Team Communication:** Designers, developers, and clients all refer to the same blueprint.
- **Guides Development:** Developers can use wireframes as a roadmap, speeding up coding and reducing guesswork.
## Wireframing in Practice

**Scenario:** An e-commerce team wireframed their checkout page.  
- **Issue Identified:** Users had no clear “Back to Cart” link, causing confusion in early tests.  
- **Resolution:** The team added a prominent “Back” button in the wireframe, and re‑tested.  
- **Impact:** In the final product, cart abandonment dropped by 15% because users could easily correct order details.

This example shows how wireframing catches usability problems before any code is written, ensuring a smoother, more user‑friendly final design.
